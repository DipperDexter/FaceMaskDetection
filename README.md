# FaceMaskDetection
College Project on Face mask Detection. 


- There are 3 Code files. Namely. 
- - mask_model training.ipynb, this file trains your model on the dataset(for which you can use any face mask detection data set from Kaggle, also I will update with the link to the dataset used in this one). 
- - mask_training_using_image.ipynbm, as the name suggests, use this file to test you model on the images. 
- - Lastly there is Mask_Testing using Video.py, using this file, to Test you model.
